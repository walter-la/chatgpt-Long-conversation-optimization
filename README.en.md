# ChatGPT Conversation Toolkit

[简体中文](./README.md) | English

A browser extension for `ChatGPT Web` focused on making long conversations easier to work with. It improves day-to-day usability with long-conversation cleanup, full-session export, in-page search, a prompt library, timeline navigation, sidebar folder management, and multilingual UI support.

Current active maintainer: `bujue3709` (primary / sole active maintainer)

## Supported Sites

- `https://chat.openai.com/*`
- `https://chatgpt.com/*`

## Browser Support

- ✅ `Microsoft Edge` (officially supported)
- ✅ `Google Chrome` (officially supported)
- ⚠️ `Firefox` (temporary loading works; full support hardening is planned)
- ⚠️ `Safari (macOS)` (under evaluation)

## Feature Highlights

- Long conversation cleanup: hide older messages, keep only the latest part visible, remember auto-optimization per conversation, and re-optimize automatically as the visible message count grows.
- Full JSON export: export the current conversation even if older messages were previously collapsed.
- In-page search: search within the current conversation, highlight matches, and jump between results.
- Prompt library: add, delete, search, categorize, sort, import JSON, export JSON, and copy prompts with one click.
- LaTeX formula copy: hover rendered formulas and copy LaTeX source in one click.
- Timeline navigation: generate timeline nodes from loaded user messages, preview them, jump to them, and move the timeline panel around.
- Conversation folders: manage chat folders above the native “Your chats” list without replacing native conversation nodes.
- Multilingual UI: currently supports Chinese and English, auto-detects the browser language, falls back to English when no match is available, and can be changed manually from the toolbar.
- Theme sync: the toolbar, timeline, prompt modal, and folder UI follow ChatGPT light/dark appearance.
- Draggable floating UI: the minimized toolbar button and timeline can both be dragged.

## How It Works

### Toolbar

After the page loads, the extension shows a floating toolbar in the bottom-right corner.

Available actions:

- Optimize long conversations
- Restore hidden messages
- Export the current conversation
- Open the prompt library
- Show or hide the timeline
- Search messages
- Change language

When collapsed, the toolbar becomes a floating button. The button can be dragged and snaps to the nearest edge when released.

The toolbar footer also includes two lightweight links:

- `Like it? Star the project ✨`
- `I have an optimization idea to share!`

### Language Support

- On startup, the extension checks the user’s browser language and tries to match it against the built-in UI languages.
- The extension currently ships with:
  - `English`
  - `简体中文`
- If the browser language does not match a supported locale, the UI falls back to `English`.
- The toolbar header includes a language switcher with:
  - `Browser default`
  - `English`
  - `简体中文`
- Manual changes apply immediately across the toolbar, timeline, prompt library, folder UI, and status messages, and the preference is saved locally.

### Long Conversation Cleanup

- “Optimize long conversations” hides older messages and keeps the latest `20` visible.
- Once a conversation is optimized manually, the extension remembers that conversation and auto-optimizes it again the next time you open it.
- Remembered conversations show a small indicator in the toolbar header so the current auto-optimization state is visible.
- If an already optimized conversation grows to `keepLatest + 10` visible messages, the extension automatically runs cleanup again and reduces the visible message count back to `keepLatest`.
- “Restore hidden messages” puts hidden messages back into the page.
- “Restore hidden messages” also clears the remembered auto-optimization state for the current conversation.
- Remembered state is cleared if the conversation is not opened again within `10` days, or if that conversation is archived.
- The restore flow tries to preserve reading position instead of jumping the page back to the top.

### Export

- “Export” downloads the current conversation as JSON.
- Export still includes all messages even if the page has already been collapsed.

### Search

- Enter a keyword in the toolbar search box and press Enter, or click the search button.
- Matches are highlighted in the conversation.
- Use previous / next navigation to move between results.
- If matching messages are currently hidden by long-conversation cleanup, restore them first.

### Timeline

- The timeline sits on the left side of the conversation area.
- It only uses user messages that are already loaded in the current page DOM.
- The node counter format is `current/total`.
- Hover a node to preview the message.
- Click a node to jump to that user message.
- The active timeline node follows page scrolling.
- The timeline supports wheel scrolling.
- The timeline panel can be dragged by its header.
- The timeline is off by default and can be toggled from the toolbar.
- If you reach the top of the timeline and there are no more visible messages:
  - it shows `已经没有消息了` when everything is already visible
  - it shows `请恢复隐藏消息` when older messages are still hidden

### Prompt Library

- Open it from the toolbar.
- Supported actions:
  - search by title, category, or content
  - filter by category
  - sort by update time, title, or category
  - add prompts
  - delete prompts
  - import JSON
  - export JSON
  - copy content with one click
- A success toast appears after copying.

### LaTeX Formula Copy

- When you hover a rendered formula, a `Copy LaTeX` button appears near that formula.
- Clicking it copies the formula's LaTeX source (not rendered plain text).
- Copy success/failure is shown in the toolbar status area.
- For `LaTeX` code blocks, use ChatGPT's native copy button on the right side of the block.

### Conversation Folders

- Folder controls appear above the sidebar “Your chats” heading.
- You can create, rename, delete, collapse, and expand folders.
- You can drag ungrouped conversations into a folder.
- You can drag conversations back out to `Ungrouped`.
- Drop targets include:
  - the folder header
  - the conversation area inside a folder
  - blank space inside the visible managed folder segment
- You can drag folder headers to reorder folders.
- Folder management only adds local classification and ordering in the sidebar. It does not replace native conversation nodes, so native rename, archive, and other built-in conversation actions remain available.
- Folder structure, assignments, collapse state, and order are persisted locally and restored after refresh.

## Configuration

Common settings live in [core/state.js](./core/state.js).

Example:

```js
const TIMELINE_VISIBLE_NODE_CAPACITY = 10;
const TIMELINE_MAX_NODES = 20;
const COLLAPSE_AUTO_REOPTIMIZE_BUFFER = 10;

const state = {
  isCollapsed: false,
  isMinimized: false,
  keepLatest: 20,
  collapsedNodes: [],
  cachedNodes: [],
};
```

Key fields:

- `keepLatest`: how many latest messages remain visible after long-conversation cleanup
- `COLLAPSE_AUTO_REOPTIMIZE_BUFFER`: how many additional visible messages are allowed before an already optimized conversation is automatically collapsed again
- `TIMELINE_VISIBLE_NODE_CAPACITY`: approximate number of timeline nodes visible in one screenful
- `TIMELINE_MAX_NODES`: maximum sampled timeline node count

## Exported Conversation JSON

```json
{
  "exportedAt": "2026-03-13T08:30:00.000Z",
  "url": "https://chatgpt.com/c/xxxxxxxx",
  "messageCount": 2,
  "messages": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "role": "user",
      "text": "Your message"
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "role": "assistant",
      "text": "ChatGPT response"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field notes:

- `exportedAt`: export timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- `url`: current conversation URL
- `messageCount`: total exported message count
- `messages`: message array
- `messages[].index`: message order
- `messages[].role`: usually `user` or `assistant`
- `messages[].text`: plain text content

## Prompt Library JSON

The prompt library exports as an object:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updatedAt": "2026-03-13T08:30:00.000Z",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "id": "c94f7299-40f3-4f95-a9f7-0ff93029a3f8",
      "title": "Daily Summary",
      "category": "Work",
      "content": "Summarize today’s work by completed items, risks, and next steps.",
      "createdAt": 1741576200000,
      "updatedAt": 1741576200000
    }
  ]
}
```

Field notes:

- `version`: format version, currently `1`
- `updatedAt`: library-level update timestamp
- `prompts`: prompt array
- `prompts[].id`: unique ID
- `prompts[].title`: title
- `prompts[].category`: category
- `prompts[].content`: prompt body
- `prompts[].createdAt`: creation timestamp
- `prompts[].updatedAt`: update timestamp

### Supported Import Shapes

The library supports two import shapes:

#### Object shape

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "title": "Code Review",
      "category": "Development",
      "content": "List issues by severity and suggest fixes."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Array shape

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Requirement Breakdown",
    "category": "Product",
    "content": "Break this down into tasks with priorities and acceptance criteria."
  }
]
```

Import rules:

- records with empty `content` are ignored
- empty `title` values are generated from the content
- empty `category` values fall back to `未分类`
- duplicates are removed using `title + category + content`, case-insensitive

## Development Notes

- This project does not use a bundler.
- After changing scripts, reload the extension from the browser extensions page.
- Script execution order is defined by the `content_scripts.js` array in [manifest.json](./manifest.json).

## Known Limitations

- The timeline only works with message nodes that are already loaded into the current page.
- Search only works on messages currently present in the DOM. If messages were hidden by cleanup, restore them first.
- LaTeX copy mainly targets rendered formula nodes. For `LaTeX` code blocks, use ChatGPT's native copy button.
- Folder management depends on the current ChatGPT sidebar DOM structure and stores classification locally. It does not sync to the ChatGPT service.
- ChatGPT DOM changes may require selector updates over time.
